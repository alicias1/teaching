# Beer Example

This document contains the code for reproducing the PCA found for the beers example in the PCA lecture for the Social Epidemiology course at LSHTM in 2019. 

This code can run in RStudio which is freely available to download, or is on the school computers. Open a new R Notebook in R and copy each line of code into a new code chunk (Ctrl-Alt-I is the default shortcut; this may not work on all computers and can be changed under Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts), making your own annotations in the whitespace.

An alternative is to save a copy of the R Notebook itself to your own H:/ drive or the place of your choosing. Notebooks are essentially text documents (in white) with inline code (in grey), so you can modify the text and code as you see fit. 

To run a command in R, press ctrl-Enter with your cursor anywhere in the line you wish to run or press the green button in the top right hand corner of a code chunk to run the entire chunk. 

As R is open source software, not every tool we might want for analysis is contained in the base programme. Some useful user written functions are in various packages. Once a package is installed, we load the functions from it using the library() command. Try loading the libraries in the code chunk below. Should any fail, uncomment the install.packages() commands by deleting the \# symbol at the start of the line and run those lines of code. Ensure the *tidyverse* is loaded last.


```{r beer_setup, include = F}
# install.packages("ggbiplot")
# install.packages("epiDisplay")
# install.packages("magrittr")
# install.packages("tidyverse")

library(ggbiplot)
library(epiDisplay)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)

#--- This line of code turns off scientific notation

## Beer Dataset

This dataset contains 123 beers from [Dieu du Ciel in Montreal][1]. Data included in this small dataset include the name of the beer, whether there is an accent in the name of the beer, its alcohol percentage by volume, its average crowdsourced rating on [RateBeer.com][2], its average crowdsourced rating for its style, the number of ratings it has received, and the style of the beer.

```{r read_beer}
#--- Read in the dataset
beers <- read.csv("./beers2.csv") 
```

## The Task

Imagine that you are tasked with producing a 'summary score' of the beers that captures each beer's essential properties, but omits all the redundant details. In fact, we really want to find the _best_ possible summary score of these data. What do we mean by _best_? We might conceive of two different aims:

First, the summary score should be able to discriminate between two beers that are essentially different to one another. Imagine if part of our summary score was based on the property of 'contains alcohol'. This would be a useless property to consider, since the vast majority of beers contain alcohol. But if we think about the _amount_ of alcohol a beer contains, this might be useful, as there is a lot of variation in the amount beers can contain. In other words, we are looking for properties of the beer to go into our summary score that maximise variance, i.e. that show a lot of spread in their values.

Second, the summary score should be able to accurately 'reconstruct' the original beer list. Imagine if part of our summary score was based on some property actually unrelated to the beer, like 'label colour'. This would likely not be a useful property, since the colour of the beer label is not likely to actually tell you anything about the _essential_ characteristics of the beer. Again, a useful characteristic might be _amount of alcohol_, since the amount of alcohol is actually very likely to tell you a lot about the other facets of the beer - a Budweiser and an imperial stout are different from each other not only by alcohol content, but also by colour, style, and probably drinker enjoyment. In other words, we are looking for properties to go into our summary score that minimise error, i.e. that are very representative of the other essential characteristics of the beer.

So overall, a good summary score 'maximises variance (across beers)' and 'minimises error (when reconstructing the list)'. Luckily, mathematically, these two aims are exactly the same.



## Underlying Process


Let's first look at conducting a PCA manually. We are first going to just try to summarise the variables of Alcohol Content and overall Drinker Rating. We do this just to illustrate the underlying mathematics, not necessarily because it is useful in practice. PCA as a whole will repeat the steps outlined below, but generalising to multiple different variables.

Let's examine two potential properties of the beer that could be combined into one summary score: strength of beer (measured in alcohol by volume, ABV %) vs. the overall rating (measured on a 5 point Likert scale). 

We produce a scatter plot of these two variables, and we conclude that as the strength of the beer increases, so does the drinker rating.

```{r plot_beer}
ggplot(beers, aes(x = abv, y = rating)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = style)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, color = "black") + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Strength of Beer vs. Drinker Rating",
       x = "Alcohol by Volume",
       y = "Drinker Rating")
```

---

### Step 1: Standardise {-}

The scale() function makes sure that each variable is standardised to have mean 0 and variance 1 such that they are comparable. This is to prevent the scale of measurement of the variables obscuring the variability in the dataset: consider that the _unscaled_ variance of a variable measured between 0-100 (e.g. style.rating in this dataset) must be more than the unscaled variance of a variable measured 1-5 (e.g. rating in this dataset). 

```{r std_beer}
#--- Standardise the variables
beers$abv.standard <- scale(beers$abv, scale = T) 
beers$rating.standard <- scale(beers$rating, scale = T)
```

---

### Step 2: Extract Covariances and Variances {-}

Now that we've standardised each of the variables, we might want to know how they vary together. We do this by extracting the covariance. With standardised variables, the covariance is equal to the correlation. 

We also know that the variance of each individual variable is 1, because we standardised each variable to have this value. The total amount of variance in the dataset is thus equal to 2.

We can summarise these variances and covariances in a matrix that shows how the variables are related to one another. If we had more variables, we could imagine extending the matrix to see how each variable is related to each of the others.

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
 & Rating & ABV \\
Rating & 1.000 & 0.683 \\
ABV & 0.683 & 1.000
\end{array}$$


```{r vcov_beer}
#--- Extract the covariance
beers %$% cov(rating.standard, abv.standard)

#--- Note that the covariance is the same as the correlation
beers %$% cor(rating.standard, abv.standard)

#--- Recreate the variance/covariance above
vcov <- c(1.000, 0.683, 0.683, 1.000)
dim(vcov) <- c(2,2)

```

Let's briefly return to our plot, this time using the standardised variables.

```{r plot_std_beer}
ggplot(beers, aes(x = abv.standard, y = rating.standard)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = style)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, color = "black") + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = -1/0.683) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Strength of Beer vs. Drinker Rating",
       x = "Alcohol by Volume",
       y = "Drinker Rating") +
  coord_equal(ratio=1)
  
```

We observe that the plot is the same, but the scale of the axes has changed. Note that the line of best fit shown on the graph happens to be the line that maximises the variance - the spread is slightly greater on ABV than it is in rating, so the line of best fit extends further in the horizontal direction than in the vertical. You can intuitively observe that the line of best fit given maximises the variance - it captures both the spread in the data along the horizontal axis and along the vertical axis.

Recall also Intro Stats, where you learned that the line of best fit (regression line) is one that minimises the distance from each of the points to the line. The sum of the squared distances from the points to the line is also known as the error. 

Since this line maximises variance and minimises error, it is a good candidate for summarising the cloud of points into a line. We call this line of best fit the 'first principal component', PC1 for short. Note that the equation of the line for PC1 is defined by both ABV *and* Drinker Rating.

The second principal component is determined by the line perpendicular to the first principal component. We have already maximised variance in one direction, but there still remains some residual variance. The residual variance is maximised in the direction perpendicular to the previous line of best fit, and this is what is shown on the graph as the light black line.

How do we usefully turn this line of best fit into a summary score?

---

### Step 3: Find the eigenvectors and rotate {-}

One way to visualise what to do with this line of best fit is to rotate the data such that the first principal component is the new x-axis. Thus, the maximum variance (or spread) is along the x axis, and the residual variance is along the y axis. The second principal component will then be on the y-axis.

The quantity by which we rotate the original data to put the first principal component on the x axis is determined by the *eigenvectors* from the variance-covariance matrix that we calculated above. We multiply the original data by the eigenvectors to get the new transformed data. Eigenvectors are sometimes called loadings: the importance of eigenvectors to interpreting PCA will become clear in a later example.

```{r eigen_beer}
#--- Get the eigenvectors
eigens <- eigen(vcov) 
eigenvectors <- eigens$vectors

#--- Extract the values of standardised ABV and standardised Rating into a matrix
vals <- as.matrix(beers %>% select(abv.standard, rating.standard))

#--- Multiply the data by the eigenvectors 
rotated <- as.data.frame(vals %*% eigenvectors) 
```

The resulting rotated data are called scores and the scores are displayed on the plot below along with the Style colour coding.

Note that now if we put a line of best fit through this data, it would be horizontal. This implies that principal component 1 and principal component 2 are independent from one another.

```{r score_beer}
#--- Extract the beer style data
style <- as.data.frame(beers$style)

#--- Link rotated data to style data and change names
rotated <- cbind(rotated, style)
colnames(rotated) <- c("pc1", "pc2", "style")

#--- Plot the new data
ggplot(rotated, aes(x = pc1, y = pc2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = style)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Strength of Beer vs. Drinker Rating",
       x = "PC1",
       y = "PC2")
```

---

### Step 4: Find the eigenvalues {-}

We know that there are 2 units of variance in the total dataset. What if we wanted to see how much of the total variance was accounted for by PC1?

We can extract the eigenvalues from the variance covariance matrix we constructed. PC1 explains 1.68/2.00 = 84% of the total variance in the dataset. Note that this new summary variable PC1 (composed of both Drinker Rating and ABV alone) explains more of the spread of the data than either Drinker Rating or ABV.

For further information on both eigenvectors and eigenvalues see [this Khan Academy video][3].

```{r eigenv_beer}
#--- Extract the eigenvalues
eigenvalues <- eigens$values
round(eigenvalues, 2)
```


## PCA Computation & Exploration

Now, all that is quite complicated. Luckily, there is a built-in function in R to do all this in the background, for as many dimensions of data as we might like! Let's do all that we did above in a few lines of code:

The prcomp() command conducts a PCA. Note that scale = T(rue) indicates that the variables must be centered (on 0) and scaled (to have variance 1) to be interpretable, as we did above. 

We can then extract the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 

'Loadings' is a term used to refer to the eigenvectors when they are transformed by multiplication by the square root of the eigenvalues. Mathematically, this is done such that the loadings can be interpreted directly as the correlation between the component and the variable. Untransformed eigenvectors themselves are not useful for interpretation of a PCA - I use the two terms 'eigenvector' and 'loading' interchangeably although this is not strictly correct...! 

```{r pca_beer}
#--- Select the columns we want for our PCA
beercols <- beers %>% select(abv.standard, rating.standard)

#--- Conduct the PCA
beers_pca <- prcomp(beercols, scale = T)

#--- Get the eigenvectors 
beers_pca$rotation

#--- Get the eigenvalues
(beers_pca$sdev)^2

#--- Get the proportion of variance (row 2)
summary(beers_pca)


```

But what does all this really _mean_? 

## Biplots and Interpretation

It can be made clear by means of a _biplot_ that graphically displays the results of the PCA. 

```{r biplot_beer}
ggbiplot(beers_pca, obs.scale = 1, group = beers$style, ellipse = T) + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = '') +
  labs(title = "PCA: Beer variables") +
  theme_bw() 
  
```

What is this plot telling us? Each variable that went into the PCA has an associated arrow. Arrows for each variable point in the direction of increasing values of that variable. 

If you look at the 'Rating' arrow, it points towards low values of PC1 - so we know the lower the value of PC1, the higher the Drinker Rating. 

If you look at the 'ABV' arrow, it also points towards low values of PC1 - so we know the lower the value of PC1, the higher the Alcohol Content.

So we now understand that our summary score that we obtained for each beer, that is, the value of PC1, is lower if a beer is both well-regarded and high in alcohol and higher if a beer is not well-regarded and low in alcohol.

The arrows on the biplot are actually representative of the eigenvectors (loadings), so we could just as easily obtain this information from the matrix of the loadings:

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
 & PC1 & PC2 \\
ABV & -0.707 & 0.707 \\
Rating & -0.707 & -0.707
\end{array}$$



PC1 is negatively associated with ABV and Rating (the signs of the eigenvectors are negative) and therefore we would expect low values of PC1 to entail high values of ABV & Ratings. PC2 is positively associated with ABV and negatively associated with Rating, so we expect beers with high PC2 scores to be low in alcohol but highly rated.

Note that also from the biplot, we can see that higher ratings are associated with Stout (and not Lager) because the arrow points in the direction of the cluster of Stout points (in purple) and away from the cluster of Lager points (in green). Higher alcohol might be associated with Belgian beers (in orange) and not Wheat beers (in pink).

### Extending the Example

What happens if we add some more data into the PCA? Let's reconduct the PCA and include a new piece of information: the year the beer was released.

```{r pca2_beer}
#--- Select the new relevant columns
beercols2 <- beers %>% select(abv, rating, year)

#--- Conduct the PCA
beers_pca2 <- prcomp(beercols2, scale = T)

#--- Get the eigenvectors 
beers_pca2$rotation

#--- Plot the PCA
ggbiplot(beers_pca2, obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 2, group = beers$style, ellipse = T) + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = '') + 
  labs(title = "PCA: Beer variables") +
  theme_bw() 

#--- Get the eigenvalues
(beers_pca2$sdev)^2

#--- Get the proportion of variance (row 2)
summary(beers_pca2)

```

$$\begin{array}{cccc}
 & PC1 & PC2 & PC3 \\
ABV & -0.65 & 0.31 & -0.70 \\
Rating & -0.67 & 0.20 & -0.70 \\
Year & -0.37 & -0.93 & -0.08
\end{array}$$


In this case, we see that high values of PC1 are associated with low values of Alcohol Content, low Drinker Rating, and older years. So low values of PC1 are associated with well-regarded beers (loading: -0.65) that are also high in alcohol (loading: -0.67). Low values of PC1 are a little less associated with newness (loading: -0.37). PC1 explains 60.2% of the total variance, making it a fairly good summary measure.  

PC2 on the other hand (explaining 29% of the variance), is largely influenced by year (the associated loading is 0.93) - so this implies that there is some aspect of the beer data, _independent_ from being well-regarded and strong, that is explained by the newness of the beer. Note that the composite measure PC2 actually explains less of the variance than any of the given variables (ABV, Rating, Year) alone - since the total variance is 3, each variable alone would explain 33.3% of the variance.


## Social Epidemiology

So what does this all have to do with social epidemiology? 

PCA has been used in social epi in a number of different ways and it gets much more useful when there are multiple dimensions of data. PCA is used to explore relationships between variables and relationships of variables to particular clusters in the dataset. It is good for elucidating what particular **constructs** might be underlying the data. 

Sometimes, we can use the first principal component (or first and second principal components - they are uncorrelated) as a proxy measure of some underlying construct for the variables. If you had data on several measures of socioeconomic position, for example, it would be possible to use PC1 as a proxy variable for the underlying construct of SEP and to thus adjust for it in an analysis. This is what we will do in the PCA practicals.
