This secontionpractical will take you through the initial analyses a social epidemiologist might take to determine if socioeconomic position is associated with HIV risk in young Tanzanian women. The goal of this practical is not to focus on the R or Stata code, but instead to understand conceptually what is happening and be able to interpret the output critically.

This initial session will consolidate your understanding of mediation and confounding. In this session we will seek to get to know the data, calculate some basic prevalences, describe the association between educational attainment and HIV, and adjust for a potential confounder.

There is no explicit paper associated with this practical, but some papers of interest might be found here.

In this practical, we will use data from the AIDS indicator survey carried out in Tanzania in 2007. The data includes only young women aged 15-24 years of age who were residing in rural areas. The dataset contains one record for each of the 2762 young women included in the survey with information on their HIV serostatus.

Step 1 is to ensure that your R Notebook and your data are in the correct place. As long as the R Notebook and the dataset socepi_tz.dta (available from U:/Download/Teach/Social Epidemiology) are in the same place, the code below will work.

In R, not every tool we need for analysis is automatically included. We load a number of user-built libraries to make our lives easier. To run code in RStudio, you place your cursor on the line and press Ctrl-Enter, or mouse click the green triangle at the top right corner of the code chunk (in grey)


```{r}
# install.packages("readstata13")
# install.packages("epiDisplay")
# install.packages("magrittr")
# install.packages("tidyverse")

library(readstata13)
library(epiDisplay)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)

#--- Turn off scientific notation and round everything to 3 decimal places
options(scipen = 999, digits = 3)

#--- Put all plots in black and white
theme_set(theme_bw())

```

Once you have loaded in the libraries, we are going to read in the data. You should see it appear in the 'Environment' pane in the top right hand corner of RStudio as a dataset called 'tz'. You can click on the dataset in the Environment pane and it will open in a new tab. Browse through the data now. You can also explore the first few rows with the head() command below.

```{r}
#--- Read in data
tz <- read.dta("E:/LSHTM/Teaching/socepi/socepi_tz.dta", convert.factors = T)

#--- Quick view of data
View(tz)

```

Let's do a quick summary of all of the variables. In R, we use the summary() command where Stata would use _summ_ or _tab_.

What is the age range of the population? What about the average age? Have a look at the below graph that describes the age range. 

The relevant commands for each of the variables are laid out. Take a look at their summaries and also their graphs. Make a rough table of your findings. Note any associations that you think might be particularly important.

```{r}
#--- Summaries

#--- Drop any factor levels that have no observations
tz <- droplevels(tz)

#--- Age
summary(tz$age)
ggplot(tz, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()

#--- Other variables
summary(tz$serostat)
summary(tz$water)
summary(tz$toilet)
summary(tz$electricity)
summary(tz$radio)
summary(tz$tv)
summary(tz$fridge)
summary(tz$bike)
summary(tz$car)
summary(tz$floor)
summary(tz$wall)
summary(tz$roof)
summary(tz$educat)
summary(tz$married)
summary(tz$partners)

```

The below code recodes age into two different age groups, and the sexual partners variable into 0, 1, or 2+ sexual partners. 

From a measurement perspective, do you think this categorisation is useful or is there a better way to handle these variables? In other words, what are the implications of categorising these variables? Do you think this will affect your analysis? 


```{r}
#--- Recoding the age variable and specifying it is a factor
tz <- tz %>% mutate(age.group = ifelse(age < 20, "14-19", "20-24")) %>% 
             mutate(age.group = as.factor(age.group))

#--- Recoding the partner variable
tz <- tz %>% mutate(partners.cat = cut(partners,
                   breaks=c(-Inf, 0, 1, Inf), 
                   labels=c("0","1","2+")))
```

Now let's look at the prevalence of HIV in the sample. We can also examine HIV prevalence by age, education, and number of partners using either the _tabpct_ command or the _cc_ command. Use _tabpct_ to get row or column percentages and _cc_ to get an odds ratio and associated confidence interval. 

Do you notice any systematic differences in prevalence by these variables?


```{r}
#--- Stratified summaries of HIV prevalence by Age
tz %$% tabpct(serostat, age.group, percent = "col", graph = F)
tz %$% cc(serostat, age.group, graph = F)

#--- Are there trends in serostatus by age?
tz %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = serostat)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge")

#--- Stratified summaries of HIV prevalence by Education
tz %$% tabpct(educat, serostat, percent = "col", graph = F)
tz %$% cc(serostat, educat, graph = F) 

#--- Stratified summaries of HIV prevalence by Education
tz %$% tabpct(partners.cat, serostat, percent = "row", graph = F)
tz %$% cc(partners.cat, serostat, graph = F) 

```

Consider whether or not age should be considered a confounding factor on the association between education and HIV.

What possible causal diagram represents the scenario where age is a confounder?

Compare the crude and adjusted ORs. Is there any evidence for confounding from the analyses below? 

```{r}
#--- Logistic Regression
glm(serostat ~ educat + age.group, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 
```


How might you extend your causal diagram to include other potential confounders (or mediators) from this dataset? For example, what happens when we also investigate the potential confounding effect of marriage? 

On your causal diagram, which direction does the arrow go between education and marriage? How did you decide this?

```{r}
#--- Logistic Regression
glm(serostat ~ educat + age.group + married, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 
```

Using your own knowledge and that of your colleagues, or by doing a brief search of the literature, list some potential mechanisms by which education could affect HIV risk in young women in Tanzania. For example, one mechanism could be education impacting HIV risk because HIV prevention programmes are delivered in schools.

What might the causal diagram look like for each of your identified mechanisms? Are any of your identified mechanisms of action specific to a particular context? Are any of these mechanisms testable from your data? 

In the example above, our causal diagram would be amended to include a mediating variable between education and HIV risk. This mechanism would only be relevant in the context of girls who have been to school. We cannot test for this mechanism in the data as we do not have knowledge of whether HIV prevention programmes were implemented or not in each school. Note that we could collect this if we were designing an intervention or a survey - it is key in practical social epidemiology to consider possible mechanisms of action in the design phase. It is often insufficient to ask simply _whether_ there is an effect of a particular construct - we wish to know _how_ and _why_ it exists. 

This practical will take you through constructing a DHS style asset index of household wealth. We will also construct a concentration index to look at household wealth and HIV prevalence. Then, we will return to mediation to answer the question of whether the number of sexual partners mediates the relationship between educational attainment and HIV status.

Before proceeding, run the entire code that you saved from session 10. We will also need the following library for easy dummy-coding of variables.

```{r}
# install.packages("fastDummies")
library(fastDummies)
library(tidyverse)
```


We are first going to extract measures of household assets. It is reasonable to think that ownership of some of these assets may encode some information about the socioeconomic position of that household within the wider community. Note that not only might this asset index be useful for characterising relative position (tacitly invoking a psychosocial theoretical model), but it may also be useful as a direct measure of deprivation (tacitly invoking a neomaterial theoretical model).

The below code tabulates all of the frequencies and percents for each asset variable. Note that some of the asset variables have already had categories combined to ensure that low cell counts do not dramatically skew the PCA result - this kind of data tidying should be done prior to applying any kind of analysis.

Create a table of these values and indicate whether or not you think they are a marker of higher or lower socioeconomic position as you enter them into this table. 

```{r}
#--- Create a unique ID for each individual from their row number
tz <- tz %>% rowid_to_column("ID")


#--- Select just the asset variables and a unique ID
assets <- tz %>% select(ID, water:roof)

#--- Extract the summaries
assets %>% count(water) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(toilet) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(electricity) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(radio) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(tv) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(fridge) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(bike) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(car) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(floor) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(wall) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))
assets %>% count(roof) %>% mutate(pct = n*100 / sum(n))

```

We may wish to do an initial test of our assumption that the asset variables together measure some underlying construct. One way to do this is to see how the variables correlate with one another. For example, we can investigate the association between electricity access and car ownership and clearly observe that there is a strong correlation. You may wish to modify this code to investigate some other variables. 

Consider carefully what dimensions of socioeconomic position these sorts of associations might represent. For example, access to electricity is an area-level variable, constrated with car ownership which is at the level of the household, or even the individual. It may be possible that even high-SEP households still cannot access electricity if they live in an area with no electricity infrastructure - individuals may be relatively wealthy, but not wealthy enough to move or to change characteristics of their surrounding neighbourhood. 

```{r}
#--- Is there an association between electricity access and car ownership?
assets %$% cc(car, electricity, graph = F)
```

Now we will run a PCA, following Vyas et al (2004), assuming that the first principal component can be used as a measure of socioeconomic position. To unpack what's going on behind this code, it may be worth revisiting the beers example from the lecture - the associated Rmd file can also be found on Daniel's github. 

Note that we have to manually recode each categorical variable into a binary variable - dummy_cols() handles this for us in R! We also have to manually remove any individuals with missing data - we do not here take a principled approach to missing data, we will simply remove it and assume that it is missing completely at random. Depending on the degree of missing data, this would normally not be the appropriate approach! Note how many individuals were lost when we removed rows containing missing data.

```{r}
#--- Remove missing data
assets <- assets %>% drop_na()

#--- Create dummy columns
dummies <- assets %>% select(water, floor, wall, roof) %>% dummy_cols() %>% 
  select(-c(water, floor, wall, roof))

#--- Convert the remaining data into numeric variables for analysis
cols <- assets %>% select(electricity, radio, tv, fridge, car, toilet) %>% mutate_all(as.numeric) - 1

#--- Bind the dummy columns back together with the other variables
pca_cols <- cbind(cols, dummies)

#--- Conduct the PCA
assets_pca <- prcomp(pca_cols, scale = T)

#--- Get the eigenvectors for PC1-PC3
assets_pca$rotation[,1:3] %>% round(2)

#--- Get the eigenvalues (and Proportion of Variance)
summary(assets_pca)
(assets_pca$sdev)^2 %>% round(2)

```

Let's extract the eigenvectors (loadings) first. 'Loadings' is a term used to refer to the eigenvectors when they are transformed by multiplication by the square root of the eigenvalues and it is actually 'loadings' that prcomp() returns. Mathematically, this is done such that the loadings can be interpreted directly as the correlation between the component and the variable. Untransformed eigenvectors themselves are not useful for interpretation of a PCA - I use the two terms 'eigenvector' and 'loading' interchangeably although this is not strictly correct...! 

How many principal components did the PCA produce? What proportion of the total variance is explained by the first prinipal component? The second?

Which variables are associated with Principal Component 1? 

We can interpret the loadings as the correlation between the principal component and the variable - so we can see that electricity access, TV ownership, fridge ownership, having water piped to the house, and having floors and walls made of cement are associated with high values of PC1 (ascertained from the positive sign of the eigenvector, indicating a positive correlation). Having a floor made of earth or sand and a roof made of grass, thatch, or mud are associated with low values of PC1.

Do these associations make sense with your initial suggestions about which assets or household characteristics would be associated with higher socioeconomic position? 

Let's now assume that PC1 is in fact measuring SEP. We can extract the scores for each individual of PC1 and take a look at how the scores are distributed in a plot.

```{r}
#--- Extract the scores from PC1, where high scores are representative of high SEP
assets$pc1 <- assets_pca$x[,1]

#--- Get a histogram
ggplot(assets, aes(x = pc1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

What do you notice about the distribution of the SEP score? Is the SEP score better at distinguishing between low-SEP individuals or high-SEP individuals?

We can either use this score as a continuous variable, but more usually, we divide the score into quintiles.

```{r}
#--- Generate quintiles
assets <- assets %>% mutate(pc1.q = ntile(pc1, 5)) %>%
                     mutate(pc1.q = as.factor(pc1.q)) %>% 
                     mutate(pc1.q = fct_recode(pc1.q,
                                               `Low SEP` = "1",
                                               `Low-Middle SEP` = "2",
                                               `Middle SEP` = "3",
                                               `High-Middle SEP` = "4",
                                               `High SEP` = "5"))

#--- Check quintiles were appropriately created (equal numbers in each group)
summary(assets$pc1.q)

#--- Get the mean score in each quintile
assets %>% group_by(pc1.q) %>% dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(pc1))
```

Now we have two distinct measures of SEP: we have an asset/household characteristic index and we also have education, which in many contexts, is part of socioeconomic position. 

We turn our attention now to the association between these two measures of SEP and HIV prevalence.

Let's conduct some initial analyses:

```{r}
#--- Link PC1 quintiles back into the tz dataset
tz <- assets %>% select(ID, pc1.q) %>% left_join(tz, ., by = "ID")

#--- Is there an association between Asset Index & HIV Prevalence?
tz %$% tabpct(serostat, pc1.q, percent = "col", graph = F)
tz %$% cc(serostat, pc1.q, graph = F)

#--- Is there an association between Education & HIV Prevalence?
tz %$% tabpct(serostat, educat, percent = "col", graph = F)
tz %$% cc(serostat, educat, graph = F)

```

One more extensive analysis we can conduct to ascertain the association between SEP and HIV status is to construct a concentration curve. A concentration curve is designed to investigate inequality. A concentration curve ranks everyone from lowest SEP to highest SEP and compares the distribution of some health outcome against that ranking.

Consider: if everyone had equal chance of contracting HIV regardless of their SEP, then as we move from lowest SEP to highest SEP, the proportion of individuals with HIV should remain the same.  

So we want to compare how distribution of HIV status against the SEP score that we generated with the PCA.

```{r}
#--- Take a selection of the dataset for clarity, arrange from lowest to highest SEP and drop NAs
conc <- tz %>% select(ID, serostat, pc1) %>% 
               arrange(pc1) %>% 
               drop_na()

#--- Convert 'serostat' to 0s/1s
conc <- conc %>% mutate(serostat = as.numeric(serostat)-1)

#--- Get the cumulative proportion of serostat
conc$c.sero <- cumsum(conc$serostat)/sum(conc$serostat)

# The cumulative sum is a 'running total' of the number who have HIV as we go from low SEP to high SEP
# The cumulative proportion is the cumulative sum expressed as a percentage of the overall total individuals with HIV
# Note: the cumulative proportion goes from 0 to 1


#--- Get the cumulative ranking of the SEP score (i.e. this represents the proportion of individuals with a lower SEP)
conc$c.sep <- conc %$% cume_dist(pc1)

#--- Plot the concentration curve
ggplot(conc, aes(x = c.sep, y = c.sero)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_abline(color = "forestgreen") +
  labs(title = "Concentration Curve: HIV Status vs SEP",
       x = "Cumulative SEP Rank",
       y = "Cumulative HIV")

# The green line represents perfect equality: HIV being gotten at the same rate as SEP increases.

```

What do you conclude from this plot? Is there a suggestion of inequality in the patterning of HIV risk? If the answer is unclear, note that 50% of the HIV cases are accounted for by ~35% of the individuals - which 35% of the population are those individuals?

Another way we can numerically quantify this inequality is through the concentration index. The concentration index represents the amount of socioeconomic inequality in a given health variable. It is useful as it can be compared across health variables, so we can see the relative inequality for a number of different variables. The concentration index is the area between the calculated concentration curve and the line of perfect equality. A negative value indicates disproportionate concentration amongst the poor, while a positive value indicates disproportionate concentration amongst the rich.

```{r}
#--- Calculate the concentration index (using formula)
2/mean(conc$serostat) * cov(conc$serostat, conc$c.sep)

```

You may have heard of the Gini coefficient, a standardised measure of inequality. The Gini coefficient is calculated in the same way as the concentration index, by calculating the area under a particular type of concentration curve. The curve used to calculate the Gini index is called the Lorenz curve, and it uses income in place of SEP.



Returning to SEP and education, draw a causal diagram for how you think the SEP asset index, education, and HIV status are related. 

Which way did you draw the arrow between education and SEP? What is the key consideration of the population under study that leads you to draw the arrow this way?

Is SEP asset index a confounder or a mediator between education and HIV status? Is education a confounder or a mediator between SEP asset index and HIV status? 

Which of the below analyses is the correct one to investigate the association between SEP asset index and HIV status? 

```{r}
#--- Analysis unadjusted for education: OR for High SEP vs Low SEP is 0.40 (0.17, 0.98), p = 0.046
glm(serostat ~ pc1.q, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 

#--- Analysis adjusted for education: OR for High SEP vs Low SEP is 0.70 (0.28, 1.78), p = 0.455
glm(serostat ~ pc1.q + educat, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 
```

You should have concluded that the unadjusted analysis was correct. Education mediates the relationship between SEP and HIV. You should have drawn the arrow from SEP to Education - given that our population is adolescent girls and young women and the study is cross sectional, it is more likely that the SEP of the household influences education than vice versa. If we were to take a life-course approach and had more years of data, we could account for cyclical effects between education and SEP.

Note that if you were using conventional mesaures of "statistical significance" (which hopefully you never would...), you would have arisen at different conclusions depending on whether you adjusted or not - always draw the causal diagram!

Now let us examine some more mediation in this dataset. Let us hypothesise that education impacts sexual behaviour (as measured by number of partners), and that in turn, sexual behaviour impacts HIV risk. Let's also assume that age influences education, sexual behaviour, and HIV risk. Quickly sketch the causal diagram corresponding to this statement.

We will conduct a Baron & Kenny style assessment for mediation for this hypothesis as we did in the example above. We will want to look at sexual behaviour as a mediator and age as a confounder. Create a table to display the odds ratios for primary vs. no education and for secondary vs. no education in the unadjusted, adjusted, and adjusted + mediation scenarios.

```{r}
#--- Analysis without adjusting: 0.57, 0.10
glm(serostat ~ educat, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 

#--- Analysis adjusting for age group: 0.77, 0.13
glm(serostat ~ educat + age.group, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 

#--- Analysis adjusting for age group + potential mediation from number of partners: 0.85, 0.30
glm(serostat ~ educat + age.group + partners.cat, family = binomial, data = tz) %>% logistic.display() 

```

Is there a large difference in the OR when you add in the potential mediating variable of number of partners? Would you choose to further investigate number of partners as a mediator?
